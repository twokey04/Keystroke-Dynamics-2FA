# Keystroke-Dynamics-2FA

Keystroke dynamics-based two-factor authentication system built with Flask, Scikit-learn and Tensorflow that leverages artificial intelligence techniques. This project involved designing and implementing machine learning algorithms to analyze typing patterns, thereby enhancing security measures by incorporating a unique, behavioral biometric factor into the authentication process.
